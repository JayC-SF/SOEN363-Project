Alongside the album, his first book of poetry and prose under the same title was published, including the lyrics to the sixteen songs on the record. Now, on the 20th anniversary year of <i>Coke Machine Glow</i>, fans have more to delight in: the audiobook of <i>Coke Machine Glow</i> and a brand new album by Downie, released posthumously.\u00a0<br><br> <i>Coke Machine Glow</i> is a rich, haunting collection that reveals both the public and private selves of one of Canada's most enigmatic musicians. In poetry that is urban, gritty and political, as well as romantic, nostalgic and whimsical, Downie allows us a glimpse inside his world. With his acute and observing eye, he gives us snapshots of his life, both on the road and at home; he writes of loneliness and isolation; of longing and desire; of the present and the past; of dreams and nightmares; love lost and love of family. Ultimately, this book is about the distances that bridge and separate us.<br><br> Layered and deceptively simple, imbued with Downie's wit, insight, anger, compassion and rock'n'roll edge, <i>Coke Machine Glow</i> is a remarkable debut from a remarkable creator.\u00a0<br><br>This special audiobook edition features readings from Downie's family and friends, including:<br><br>Dan Ayckroyd<br> Robbie Baker<br> Andrew Cash<br> Dave Clark<br> Julie Doiron<br> Charlyn Downie<br> Clare Downie<br> Clemens Downie<br> Lou Downie<br> Mike Downie<br> Patrick Downie<br> Paula Downie<br> Willo Downie<br> Johnny Fay<br> Josh Finlayson<br> Sarah Harmer<br> Kevin Hearn<br> Dave \"Billy Ray\" Koster<br> Paul Langlois<br> Andy Maize<br> Ron MacLean<br> Bruce McCulloch<br> Dale Morningstar<br> Larry Murphy<br> Andrea Nann<br> Dr. Pee<br> Damian Rogers<br> Jonathan Shedletzky<br> Gord Sinclair<br> Kaya Usher",

Now, on the 20th anniversary year of &lt;i&gt;Coke Machine Glow&lt;/i&gt;, fans have more to delight in: the audiobook of &lt;i&gt;Coke Machine Glow&lt;/i&gt; and a brand new album by Downie, released posthumously.\u00a0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Coke Machine Glow&lt;/i&gt; is a rich, haunting collection that reveals both the public and private selves of one of Canada&#39;s most enigmatic musicians. In poetry that is urban, gritty and political, as well as romantic, nostalgic and whimsical, Downie allows us a glimpse inside his world. With his acute and observing eye, he gives us snapshots of his life, both on the road and at home; he writes of loneliness and isolation; of longing and desire; of the present and the past; of dreams and nightmares; love lost and love of family. Ultimately, this book is about the distances that bridge and separate us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Layered and deceptively simple, imbued with Downie&#39;s wit, insight, anger, compassion and rock&#39;n&#39;roll edge, &lt;i&gt;Coke Machine Glow&lt;/i&gt; is a remarkable debut from a remarkable creator.\u00a0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This special audiobook edition features readings from Downie&#39;s family and friends, including:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dan Ayckroyd&lt;br&gt; Robbie Baker&lt;br&gt; Andrew Cash&lt;br&gt; Dave Clark&lt;br&gt; Julie Doiron&lt;br&gt; Charlyn Downie&lt;br&gt; Clare Downie&lt;br&gt; Clemens Downie&lt;br&gt; Lou Downie&lt;br&gt; Mike Downie&lt;br&gt; Patrick Downie&lt;br&gt; Paula Downie&lt;br&gt; Willo Downie&lt;br&gt; Johnny Fay&lt;br&gt; Josh Finlayson&lt;br&gt; Sarah Harmer&lt;br&gt; Kevin Hearn&lt;br&gt; Dave &#34;Billy Ray&#34; Koster&lt;br&gt; Paul Langlois&lt;br&gt; Andy Maize&lt;br&gt; Ron MacLean&lt;br&gt; Bruce McCulloch&lt;br&gt; Dale Morningstar&lt;br&gt; Larry Murphy&lt;br&gt; Andrea Nann&lt;br&gt; Dr. Pee&lt;br&gt; Damian Rogers&lt;br&gt; Jonathan Shedletzky&lt;br&gt; Gord Sinclair&lt;br&gt; Kaya Usher",

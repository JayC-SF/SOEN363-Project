She believes that she has made the unnatural choice of staying alive to love her human family and now lives in fear of the consequences of that decision.&lt;/p&gt;<br/>\t\t&lt;p&gt;Some of Kambirinachi\u2019s worst fears come true when her daughter, Kehinde, experiences a devasting childhood trauma that causes the family to fracture in seemingly irreversible ways. As soon as she\u2019s of age, Kehinde moves away and cuts contact with her twin sister and mother. Alone in Montreal, she struggles to find ways to heal while building a life of her own. Meanwhile, Taiye, plagued by guilt for what happened to her sister, flees to London and attempts to numb the loss of the relationship with her twin through reckless hedonism.&lt;/p&gt;<br/>\t\t&lt;p&gt;Now, after more than a decade of living apart, Taiye and Kehinde have returned home to Lagos to visit their mother. It is here that the three women must face each other and address the wounds of the past if they are to reconcile and move forward.&lt;/p&gt;<br/>\t\t&lt;p&gt;Bespeak Audio Editions brings Canadian voices to the world with audiobook editions of some of the country\u2019s greatest works of literature, performed by Canadian actors.&lt;/p&gt;",

Americans have built an empire on the idea of \"race,\" a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men-bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?<br><br> <i>Between the World and Me </i>is Ta-Nehisi Coates's attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son-and readers-the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children's lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, <i>Between the World and Me </i>clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Between the World and Me</i></b><br><br>\"I've been wondering who might fill the intellectual void that plagued me after James Baldwin died. Clearly it is Ta-Nehisi Coates. The language of <i>Between the World and Me, </i>like Coates's journey, is visceral, eloquent, and beautifully redemptive. And its examination of the hazards and hopes of black male life is as profound as it is revelatory.\"<b>-Toni Morrison</b><br><br> \"Powerful and passionate . . . profoundly moving . . . a searing meditation on what it means to be black in America today.\"<b>-Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br> \"Really powerful and emotional.\"<b>-John Legend, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br> \"Extraordinary.\"<b>-David Remnick, <i>The New Yorker</i></b><br><br> \"Brilliant . . . a mature writer entirely consumed by a momentous subject and working at the extreme of his considerable powers.\"<b>-<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br><br> \"An eloquent blend of history, reportage, and memoir.\"<b>-<i>The Boston Globe</i></b><br><br> \"[Coates] speaks resolutely and vividly to all of black America.\"<b>-<i>Los Angeles Times</i></b><br><br> \"A work that's both titanic and timely . . .\u00a0the latest essential reading in America's social canon.\"<b>-<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b>",

Americans have built an empire on the idea of &#34;race,&#34; a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men-bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Between the World and Me &lt;/i&gt;is Ta-Nehisi Coates&#39;s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son-and readers-the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children&#39;s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, &lt;i&gt;Between the World and Me &lt;/i&gt;clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Between the World and Me&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#34;I&#39;ve been wondering who might fill the intellectual void that plagued me after James Baldwin died. Clearly it is Ta-Nehisi Coates. The language of &lt;i&gt;Between the World and Me, &lt;/i&gt;like Coates&#39;s journey, is visceral, eloquent, and beautifully redemptive. And its examination of the hazards and hopes of black male life is as profound as it is revelatory.&#34;&lt;b&gt;-Toni Morrison&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &#34;Powerful and passionate . . . profoundly moving . . . a searing meditation on what it means to be black in America today.&#34;&lt;b&gt;-Michiko Kakutani, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &#34;Really powerful and emotional.&#34;&lt;b&gt;-John Legend, &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &#34;Extraordinary.&#34;&lt;b&gt;-David Remnick, &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &#34;Brilliant . . . a mature writer entirely consumed by a momentous subject and working at the extreme of his considerable powers.&#34;&lt;b&gt;-&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &#34;An eloquent blend of history, reportage, and memoir.&#34;&lt;b&gt;-&lt;i&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &#34;[Coates] speaks resolutely and vividly to all of black America.&#34;&lt;b&gt;-&lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &#34;A work that&#39;s both titanic and timely . . .\u00a0the latest essential reading in America&#39;s social canon.&#34;&lt;b&gt;-&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;",

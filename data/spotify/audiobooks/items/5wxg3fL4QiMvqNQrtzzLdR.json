While our hearts are primed for compassionate connection, our nervous systems\u2014which store all our past hurts and disappointments\u2014are wired for threat and negativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, leading relationship advice has maintained that successful relationships require a specific compromise\u2014that we must change our authentic expression to better meet the needs of others, and vice versa. It may sound reasonable in theory, but as Dr. LePera explains, this approach is nothing less than a recipe for a lifetime of resentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In\u00a0&lt;em&gt;How to Be the Love You Seek&lt;/em&gt;,\u00a0#1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;\u00a0bestselling author&lt;em&gt;\u00a0&lt;/em&gt;Dr. LePera\u2014whose integrative, holistic approach to psychology has attracted an international audience of millions\u2014offers a new path to healing our relationships. Harnessing the latest scientific research, she teaches us to recognize how unmet needs from our earliest relationships create our current, dysfunctional relationship patterns, and leave us in a state of constant internal threat, even with those closest to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book, the last in her \u201cHow To\u201d trilogy, illuminates the way out of trauma bonds and into relationships rooted in mutual respect and compassion. In it, you will learn how to create safety in your own body and mind; identify your unmet needs; develop emotional resilience; cultivate heart coherence to build deep emotional connections with others; and maintain healthy interdependence in our communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you struggle to maintain the kinds of relationships you want, or are facing a specific challenge with a spouse, partner, parent, sibling, child, friend, or colleague\u2014Dr. LePera teaches us how to break painful cycles and reconnect with the wisdom, appreciation, and compassion that lives in each of our hearts. It is our heart\u2019s innate capacity to love that is the true source of all healing. When we tap into that power, we can become the love we seek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete with stories, exercises, journal prompts, and other practical tools,\u00a0&lt;em&gt;How to Be the Love You Seek&lt;/em&gt; offers a healing roadmap for all generations of cycle-breakers.&lt;/p&gt;",

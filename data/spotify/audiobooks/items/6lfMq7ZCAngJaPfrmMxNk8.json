  "description": "Author(s): Saul Kassin, Ph. D.\nNarrator(s): Johnny Heller\n\n\u201cAs you read this blurb, you know you would never confess to a crime you didn\u2019t commit. Read this compelling study and you\u2019ll change your mind. Dr. Kassin lays bare the dirty tricks used by police to make innocents confess. And he describes, convincingly, what should be done to stop them.\u201d<br>\u2013 John Grisham, #1 New York Times-bestselling author<br><br>Written by the world's leading expert on false confessions, this landmark book reveals the psychology behind why innocent men, women, and children, intensely stressed and befuddled by the promises, threats, trickery, and deception of a police interrogation, are duped into confession, no matter how horrific the crime. Featuring riveting case studies, highly original research, work done in tandem with the Innocence Project, and quotes from individuals who confessed to crimes they did not commit, Duped tells the story of how this happens, how the system turns a blind eye, and how to make it stop.<br><br><br>Why do people confess to crimes they did not commit? And, surely, those cases must be rare? In fact, it happens all the time\u2014in police stations, workplaces, public schools, and the military.

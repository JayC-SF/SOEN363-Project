    "description": "Author(s): Gretchen Rubin\nNarrator(s): Gretchen Rubin\n\n<p><b><i>New York Times</i> Bestseller</b><br> <b><i>Washington Post</i> Bestseller</b><br> <b> </b><br> <b>The author of the blockbuster <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, <i>The Happiness Project</i> and <i>Happier at Home,</i> tackles the critical question: How do we change? </b><br>  <br> Gretchen Rubin's answer: through <i>habits</i>. Habits are the invisible architecture of everyday life. It takes work to make a habit, but once that habit is set, we can harness the energy of habits to build happier, stronger, more productive lives.<br>  <br> So if habits are a key to change, then what we really need to know is: <i>How do we change our habits</i>?<br>  <br> <i>Better than Before</i> answers that question. It presents a practical, concrete framework to allow readers to understand their habits-and to change them for good. Infused with Rubin's compelling voice, rigorous research, and easy humor, and packed with vivid stories of lives transformed, <i>Better than Before</i> explains the (sometimes counter-intuitive) core principles of habit formation. <br>  <br> Along the way, Rubin uses herself as guinea pig, tests her theories on family and friends, and answers readers' most pressing questions-oddly, questions that other writers and researchers tend to ignore: <br><br>• Why      do I find it tough to create a habit for something I <i>love</i> to      do? <br>• Sometimes      I can change a habit overnight, and sometimes I can't change a habit, no      matter how hard I try. Why? <br>• How      quickly can I change a habit? <br>• What      can I do to make sure I stick to a new habit? <br>• How      can I help someone else change a habit?  <br>• Why      can I keep habits that benefit others, but can't make habits that are just      for me? <br><br> Whether readers want to get more sleep, stop checking their devices, maintain a healthy weight, or finish an important project, habits make change possible. Reading just a few chapters of <i>Better Than Before</i> will make readers eager to start work on their own habits-even before they've finished the book.</p><p><b>Bonus Feature: </b>Includes a full episode from the author's podcast <i>Happier with Gretchen Rubin</i> in which she discusses how to build happier habits into everyday life.</p>",

Delivered with virtuoso aplomb.” —<i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br>In the last few years, following the publication of his debut novel <i>Jonny Appleseed</i>, Joshua Whitehead has emerged as one of the most exciting and important new voices on Turtle Island. Now, in this first non-fiction work, Whitehead brilliantly explores Indigeneity, queerness, and the relationships between body, language and land through a variety of genres (essay, memoir, notes, confession). <i>Making Love with the Land</i> is a startling, heartwrenching look at what it means to live as a queer Indigenous person \"in the rupture\" between identities. In sharp, surprising, unique pieces—a number of which have already won awards—Whitehead illuminates this particular moment, in which both Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples are navigating new (and old) ideas about \"the land.\" He asks: What is our relationship and responsibility towards it? And how has the land shaped our ideas, our histories, our very bodies?<br><br>Here is an intellectually thrilling, emotionally captivating love song—a powerful revelation about the library of stories land and body hold together, waiting to be unearthed and summoned into word.",

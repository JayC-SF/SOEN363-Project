Kendi's concept of antiracism reenergizes and reshapes the conversation about racial justice in America&mdash;but even more fundamentally, points us toward liberating new ways of thinking about ourselves and each other. In <i>How to Be an Antiracist,</i> Kendi asks us to think about what an antiracist society might look like, and how we can play an active role in building it.</P><P>In this audiobook, Kendi weaves an electrifying combination of ethics, history, law, and science, bringing it all together with an engaging personal narrative of his own awakening to antiracism. <i>How to Be an Antiracist</i> is an essential work for anyone who wants to go beyond an awareness of racism to the next step: contributing to the formation of a truly just and equitable society.</P>",

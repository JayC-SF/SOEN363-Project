She goes to school, helps with the cooking and cleaning at home, and works with her parents at the local farmer’s market. One Saturday, however, excitement shows up in the form of a determined lawyer from New York City who insists she needs a family cookie recipe to win a multi-million-dollar lawsuit.</p><p>Beth’s parents are bemused, but her grandmother is equally determined that the recipe will not leave her kitchen. As she tries to balance her love for her family and her faith with the promises of adventure New York could bring to her future, Beth learns that she is stronger than she believes. And sometimes, adventures happen close to home.</p>",

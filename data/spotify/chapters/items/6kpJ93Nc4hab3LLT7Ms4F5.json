    "description": "Author(s): Allison Grey\nNarrator(s): Katy Sobey\n\n<p><strong>A notorious thief joins up with Belgravia’s most eligible gentleman to steal for Queen and country…</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>London, 1879.</strong> <strong>Della Rose</strong> scans the crowds until she finds her target. A well-dressed gentleman with a fine gold watch. Stealing it will be easy. Everyone knows she has the quickest hands in the notorious Seven Dials.</p>\n\n<p>The gentleman’s name is <strong>Cole Winthrop</strong> and he’s been watching her for a while, waiting to see whether the scandalous things people say about her are true. Because if they are, he needs her help. Something was stolen from him long ago. And only a thief can get it back.</p>\n\n<p>But to do so, Della must first learn how to walk, talk, ride and flirt like a lady. Only then will she be welcomed into Cole’s glamorous world of lavish balls and high tea – and catch the eye of the villainous Duke of Salisbury, so she can crack his safe and steal its mysterious contents.</p>\n\n<p>When Cole finally trusts her enough to reveal his greatest secret, Della understands that completing the job is about more than earning the money to start a new life. The safety of the entire country rests on her shoulders. And this thief won’t let a small matter of falling in love get in her way…</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>With irresistible charm, sparkling romance and an unforgettable heroine, The Lady Thief of Belgravia will delight fans of Evie Dunmore, Minerva Spencer and Julia Quinn’s Bridgerton.</em></strong></p>",

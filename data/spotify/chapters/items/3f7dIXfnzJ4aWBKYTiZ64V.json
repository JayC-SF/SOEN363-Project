We’re deluged with advice on becoming more productive and efficient and life hacks to optimize our days.

Rejecting the futile modern obsession with “getting everything done,” <i>Four Thousand Weeks</i> introduces readers to tools for constructing a meaningful life by embracing finitude, showing that many of the unhelpful ways we’ve come to think about time aren’t inescapable, unchanging truths, but choices we’ve made as individuals and as a society—and that we can do things differently.<br><br>Embrace your limits.

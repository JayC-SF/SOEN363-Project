By doing so, he proved that he didn't need a major label to surpass over a billion streams on Spotify/Apple Music, get on Forbes' 2019 \"30 Under 30\", make the Forbes' \"30 Under 30 Cash Kings\" at number 20 for most earned, sell out arenas across the US and around the globe, and become one of the most popular and engaged rappers right now. His method was simple: love and believe in yourself absolutely and work hard no matter what. In this memoir, Russ inspires listeners to walk to their individual rhythms and beat their biggest obstacles: themselves.</p> <p>With chapters named after his most powerful and popular songs, <em>It's All in Your Head</em> will reflect on the lessons he's learned from his career, family, and relationships. He'll push listeners to bet on themselves, take those leaps of faith, and recognize struggles as opportunities. With illustrations throughout consistent with the brand Russ has built and his fan base loves, <em>It's All in Your Head</em> will give listeners an inside-look at the man and the motivation behind the music. A lover of books like <em>The Alchemist</em> and <em>The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success</em>, Russ delivers a short, potent, inspirational, raw, and honest audiobook that gives listeners a way to find self-belief and unlock their potential. Fans already rely on Russ as an inspiration of confidence; now, he is taking it to the next level with this audiobook, which will contain lyrics from his music that reflect his inimitable style.</p>",

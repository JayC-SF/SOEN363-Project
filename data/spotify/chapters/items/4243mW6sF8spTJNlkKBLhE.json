In a voice startlingly intimate and rich, Norma Jeane tells her own story of an emblematic American artist—intensely conflicted and driven—who had lost her way. A powerful portrait of Hollywood’s myth and an extraordinary woman’s heartbreaking reality, <em>Blonde</em> is a sweeping epic that pays tribute to the elusive magic and devastation behind the creation of the great 20th-century American star. </p>",

    "description": "Author(s): T.C. LoTempio\nNarrator(s): Maria Ru-Djen\n\n\"The Bon-Appetempting Pizza Bake-Off has the small town of Branson, Georgia, buzzing—not least its organizer, Southern Style's food critic and blogger Tiffany Austin. But right before the finals one of the celebrity judges falls ill, and to Tiffany's horror, the magazine replaces him with none other than handsome TV star and restaurateur Bartholomew Driscoll. Tiffany once gave his restaurant a poor review, and she's convinced he's only accepted the job to get revenge. She fully expects Driscoll will find a way to ruin the contest—but she definitely doesn't expect to trip over his dead body backstage! Soon, it's clear Tiffany wasn't the only person who had less than positive feelings towards the sharp-tongued Driscoll. She's surrounded by suspects, but which of the motley crew of contestants, family members, and scorned friends and colleagues had the guts to commit murder? With the help of her BFF Hilary and annoyingly handsome detective Bartell, and with cat Lily and puppy Cooper as emotional support, Tiffany investigates, only to discover that revenge is indeed a dish best served cold... A Crust to Die For is an appetizing culinary cozy for fans of Joanne Fluke, Lucy Burdette, Krista Davis, and Jenn McKinlay. Lovers of smart, savvy female sleuths, twisty mysteries, and mouth-watering food shouldn't miss it!\"",

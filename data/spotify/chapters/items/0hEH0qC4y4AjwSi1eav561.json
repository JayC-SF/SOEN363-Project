    "description": "Author(s): Dr. Nicole LePera\nNarrator(s): Courtney Patterson\n\n<p><strong>#1 <em>NEW YORK TIMES</em> BESTSELLER </strong>· <strong> INSTANT INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER</strong><strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong>From Dr. Nicole LePera, creator of \"the holistic psychologist\"—the online phenomenon with more than two million Instagram followers—comes a revolutionary approach to healing that harnesses the power of the self to produce lasting change.</strong><br/><br/>As a clinical psychologist, Dr. Nicole LePera often found herself frustrated by the limitations of traditional psychotherapy. Wanting more for her patients—and for herself—she began a journey to develop a united philosophy of mental, physical and spiritual wellness that equips people with the interdisciplinary tools necessary to heal themselves. After experiencing the life-changing results herself, she began to share what she’d learned with others—and soon “The Holistic Psychologist” was born.</p><p>Now, Dr. LePera is ready to share her much-requested protocol with the world. In <em>How to Do the Work,</em> she offers both a manifesto for SelfHealing as well as an essential guide to creating a more vibrant, authentic, and joyful life. Drawing on the latest research from a diversity of scientific fields and healing modalities, Dr. LePera helps us recognize how adverse experiences and trauma in childhood live with us, resulting in whole body dysfunction—activating harmful stress responses that keep us stuck engaging in patterns of codependency, emotional immaturity, and trauma bonds. Unless addressed, these self-sabotaging behaviors can quickly become cyclical, leaving people feeling unhappy, unfulfilled, and unwell. </p><p>In <em>How to Do the Work,</em> Dr. LePera offers readers the support and tools that will allow them to break free from destructive behaviors to reclaim and recreate their lives. Nothing short of a paradigm shift, this is a celebration of empowerment that will forever change the way we approach mental wellness and self-care.</p><p>Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook.</p>",

Earth has been destroyed by a comet, and only a few hundred scientists and their children—among them Petra and her family—have been chosen to journey to a new planet. They are the ones who must carry on the human race.<br />Hundreds of years later, Petra wakes to this new planet—and the discovery that she is the only person who remembers Earth. A sinister Collective has taken over the ship during its journey, bent on erasing the sins of humanity’s past. They have systematically purged the memories of all aboard—or purged them altogether.<br />Petra alone now carries the stories of our past, and with them, any hope for our future. Can she make them live again?<br />Pura Belpré Honor–winning author Donna Barba Higuera presents us with a brilliant journey through the stars, to the very heart of what makes us human.<br />* \"Gripping, euphonious, and full of storytelling magic.\"—Publishers Weekly, starred review",

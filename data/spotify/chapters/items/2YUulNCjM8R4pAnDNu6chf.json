    "description": "Author(s): Xio Axelrod\nNarrator(s): Benjamin Charles, Tyla Collier\n\nOnce upon a time, the pressure to be the perfect daughter her demanding mother needed nearly broke Mikayla Whitman. Desperate to find an outlet, she picked up a pair of drumsticks, forever altering the rhythm of her life. Since then, she’s been determined to make her own way, finding her home with her bandmates even as she fights to keep her past and her present firmly separate. The only thing Tyrell Baldwin loves more than his books is his solitude. Recently released from prison for a crime he didn’t commit, he’s searching for a fresh start. Taking a job as a tour-bus driver for an up-and-coming all-girl band might seem like a strange fit for a man allergic to the spotlight, but he can’t deny there’s something about getting a front row seat to the meteoric rise of the Lillys…especially if that means getting closer to fierce, enigmatic drummer, Kayla. Their connection is intense, but when a tabloid exposé threatens to destroy Ty’s newfound peace and Kayla’s carefully guarded secrets, Kayla’s forced to make an impossible choice: pursue her dream and risk destroying everyone around her? Or give in and let an industry famous for chewing girls up and spitting them out claim another bright young star?",

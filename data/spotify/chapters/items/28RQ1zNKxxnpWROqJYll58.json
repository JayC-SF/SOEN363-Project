    "description": "Author(s): Mike Tyson, Larry Sloman\nNarrator(s): Joshua Henry\n\n<p><b>A bare-knuckled, tell-all memoir from Mike Tyson, the onetime heavyweight champion of the world-and a legend both in and out of the ring.</b></p><p>Philosopher, Broadway headliner, fighter, felon-Mike Tyson has defied stereotypes, expectations, and a lot of conventional wisdom during his three decades in the public eye. Bullied as a boy in the toughest, poorest neighborhood in Brooklyn, Tyson grew up to become one of the most thrilling and ferocious boxers of all time-and the youngest heavyweight champion ever. But his brilliance in the ring was often compromised by reckless behavior. Years of hard partying, violent fights, and criminal proceedings took their toll: by 2003, Tyson had hit rock bottom, a convicted felon, completely broke, the punch line to a thousand bad late-night jokes. Yet he fought his way back; the man who once admitted being addicted \"to everything\" regained his success, his dignity, and the love of his family. With a triumphant one-man stage show, his unforgettable performances in the <i>Hangover </i>films, and his newfound happiness and stability as a father and husband, Tyson's story is an inspiring American original.</p><p>Brutally honest, raw, and often hilarious, Tyson chronicles his tumultuous highs and lows in the same sincere, straightforward manner we have come to expect from this legendary athlete. A singular journey from Brooklyn's ghettos to worldwide fame to notoriety, and, finally, to a tranquil wisdom, <i>Undisputed Truth </i>is not only a great sports memoir but an autobiography for the ages.",

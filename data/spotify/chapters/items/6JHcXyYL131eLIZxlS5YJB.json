    "description": "Author(s): Sheldon Pearce\nNarrator(s): Ashton Grooms, Aden Hakimi, Cary Hite, Fred Sanders, Guy Lockard, Heather Alicia Simms, Jackie Sanders, JD Jackson, Landon Woodson, Leon Nixon, Pete Simonelli, Robin Miles\n\n<b>A <i>New Yorker</i> writer’s intimate, revealing account of Tupac Shakur’s life and legacy, timed to the fiftieth anniversary of his birth and twenty-fifth anniversary of his death.</b><br><br>In the summer of 2020, Tupac Shakur’s single “Changes” became an anthem for the worldwide protests against the murder of George Floyd. The song became so popular, in fact, it was vaulted back onto the iTunes charts more than twenty years after its release—making it clear that Tupac’s music and the way it addresses systemic racism, police brutality, mass incarceration, income inequality, and a failing education system is just as important now as it was back then.<br> <br>In <i>Changes</i>, published to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of Tupac’s birth and twenty-fifth anniversary of his death, Sheldon Pearce offers one of the most thoughtful and comprehensive accounts yet of the artist’s life and legacy. Pearce, an editor and writer at <i>The New Yorker</i>, interviews dozens who knew Tupac throughout various phases of his life. While there are plenty of bold-faced names, the book focuses on the individuals who are lesser known and offer fresh stories and rare insight. Among these are the actor who costarred with him in a Harlem production of <i>A Raisin in the Sun </i>when he was twelve years old, the high school drama teacher who recognized and nurtured his talent, the music industry veteran who helped him develop a nonprofit devoted to helping young artists, the Death Row Records executive who has never before spoken on the record, and dozens of others. Meticulously woven together by Pearce, their voices combine to portray Tupac in all his complexity and contradiction.<br> <br>This remarkable book illustrates not only how he changed during his brief twenty-five years on this planet, but how he forever changed the world.",

    "description": "Author(s): Timothy Janovsky\nNarrator(s): Mark Sanderlin\n\n<br />“Game show antics, idiots in love, and a healthy dose of steam…this book is everything I want in a romance novel!” —Alison Cochrun, author of <em>The Charm Offensive</em> and <em>Kiss Her Once for Me</em><br /><br /><strong>Ready. Set. </strong><em><strong>Faux</strong></em><strong>.</strong><br /><br />Holden James picked the <em>worst</em> time to have a meltdown. His chance to audition for his favorite game show, <em>Madcap Market</em>, should have been a moment of triumph—a glorious, loving homage to his adored mom, who died six years ago. Instead, he’s destroying the minibar in a grim Los Angeles hotel room…recently dumped, partnerless and sliding into a crushing black hole of anguish.<br /><br />But the hotel service in abject misery is sublime. It even comes with an unfairly fit and sexy (smart-ass) concierge who arrives at the door with pizza, Monopoly and deliciously distracting forearms.<br /><br />All Holden knows about Leo Min is that he’s beautiful and unexpectedly sympathetic, and the chemistry between them is <em>beyond</em>. Maybe it’s even enough to convince everyone, including the show’s casting directors, that they’re a real couple. All they’d have to do is crush the competition, win the huge cash prize and all of Holden’s problems—his broken heart, his buried grief, his complete lack of money and direction—will be fixed.<br /><br />Of course, reality doesn’t quite work out that way. But love is an entirely <em>different </em>game…<br />",

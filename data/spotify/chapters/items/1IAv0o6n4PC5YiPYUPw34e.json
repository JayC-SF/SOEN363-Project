It was perfect.” </B><BR />  <BR /><B>“Gave me all the feels, and even made me question my own personal goals.”  </B><BR />  <BR /><B>“Hands down one of the best stories of love I’ve ever read. A true masterpiece.” </B><BR />  <BR /><B>“The perfect story of Black love and Black history. I feel like this book was written for my soul.”</B><BR />  <BR /><B>“Atmospheric, haunting, beautiful, lyrical, I could wax poetic on this story forever and never do it justice.”</B><BR /><BR /><BR /> Leap years are a strange, enchanted time. And for some, even a single February can be life-changing.<BR /><BR /> Ricki Wilde has many talents, but being a Wilde isn’t one of them. As the impulsive, artistic daughter of a powerful Atlanta dynasty, she’s the opposite of her famous socialite sisters. Where they’re long-stemmed roses, she’s a dandelion: an adorable bloom that’s actually a weed, born to float wherever the wind blows. In her bones, Ricki knows that somewhere, a different, more exciting life awaits her.<BR /><BR /> When regal nonagenarian, Ms. Della, invites her to rent the bottom floor of her Harlem brownstone, Ricki jumps at the chance for a fresh beginning. She leaves behind her family, wealth, and chaotic romantic decisions to realize her dream of opening a flower shop. And just beneath the surface of her new neighborhood, the music, stories and dazzling drama of the Harlem Renaissance still simmers.<BR /><BR /> One evening in February as the heady, curiously off-season scent of night-blooming jasmine fills the air, Ricki encounters a handsome, deeply mysterious stranger who knocks her world off balance in the most unexpected way.  <BR /><BR /> Set against the backdrop of modern Harlem and Renaissance glamour,<I> A Love Song for Ricki Wilde</I> is a swoon-worthy love story of two passionate artists drawn to the magic, romance, and opportunity of New York, and whose lives are uniquely and irreversibly linked.",

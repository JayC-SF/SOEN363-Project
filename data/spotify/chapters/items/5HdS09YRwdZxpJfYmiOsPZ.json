Soon Shadow learns that the past never dies . . . and that beneath the placid surface of everyday life a storm is brewing—an epic war for the very soul of America—and that he is standing squarely in its path.</p><p><strong>“Mystery, satire, sex, horror, poetic prose—<em>American Gods</em> uses all these to keep the reader turning the pages.”—<em>Washington Post</em></strong></p>",

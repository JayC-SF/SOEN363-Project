Kuang\nNarrator(s): Helen Laser\n\n<p><strong>INSTANT <em>NEW YORK TIMES</em> BESTSELLER • A REESE'S BOOK CLUB PICK</strong></p><p><strong>“Hard to put down, harder to forget.”</strong> — <strong>Stephen King, #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author</strong></p><p><strong>White lies. Dark humor. Deadly consequences… Bestselling sensation Juniper Song is not who she says she is, she didn’t write the book she claims she wrote, and she is most certainly <em>not </em>Asian American—in this chilling and hilariously cutting novel from R.F.

But Athena’s a literary darling. June Hayward is literally nobody.

So what if she lets her new publisher rebrand her as Juniper Song—complete with an ambiguously ethnic author photo? Doesn’t this piece of history deserve to be told, whoever the teller? That’s what June claims, and the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list seems to agree.</p><p>But June can’t get away from Athena’s shadow, and emerging evidence threatens to bring June’s (stolen) success down around her. As June races to protect her secret, she discovers exactly how far she will go to keep what she thinks she deserves.</p><p>With its totally immersive first-person voice, <em>Yellowface</em> grapples with questions of diversity, racism, and cultural appropriation, as well as the terrifying alienation of social media. R.F. Kuang’s novel is timely, razor-sharp, and eminently readable. </p>",

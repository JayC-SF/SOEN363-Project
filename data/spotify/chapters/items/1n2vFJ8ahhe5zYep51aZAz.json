Following men and boys bewildered by their circumstances and swayed by desire, surprised<br />by love and by their capacity for both tenderness and violence, and featuring a novella about a young woman who<br />rejects the laws of her cloistered Mennonite community, Scotiabank Giller Prize–winner David Bergen’s latest deftly<br />renders complex moral ambiguities and asks what it means to be lost—and how we might be found.",

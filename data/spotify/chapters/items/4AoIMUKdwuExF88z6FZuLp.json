    "description": "Author(s): Emily St. John Mandel\nNarrator(s): John Lee, Dylan Moore, Arthur Morey, Kirsten Potter\n\n<p><strong><em>NEW YORK TIMES</em> BESTSELLER</strong></p><p><strong>NATIONAL BESTSELLER</strong></p><p>“One of [Mandel’s] finest novels and one of her most satisfying forays into the arena of speculative fiction yet.” —<em>The New York Times</em> </p><p>“Mandel’s sensational sixth novel offers immense pleasures of puzzle box plotting and high-flying imagination. . . . Masterfully plotted and deeply moving, this visionary novel folds back on itself like a hall of mirrors to explore just what connects us to one another, and how many extraordinary contingencies bring us to each ordinary day of our lives.” —<em>Esquire</em> <strong> </strong></p><p><strong>From the acclaimed, bestselling author of <em>Station Eleven</em> and <em>The Glass Hotel</em>, a “bold and exciting” (<em>The</em> <em>Economist</em>) and “transcendent” (<em>Wall Street Journal</em>) novel filled with “</strong><strong>puncturing emotional truths”</strong> <strong>(<em>Glamour</em>)  </strong></p><p>In this captivating tale of imagination and ambition, a seemingly disparate array of people come into contact with a time traveller who must resist the pull to change the past and the future. The cast includes a British exile on the west coast of Canada in the early 1900s; the author of a bestselling novel about a fictional pandemic who embarks on a galaxy-spanning book tour during the outbreak of an actual pandemic; a resident of a moon colony almost 300 years in the future; and a lonely girl who films an old-growth forest and experiences a disruption in the recording. Blurring the lines between reality and fantasy, Emily St. John Mandel’s dazzling story follows these engrossing characters across space and time as their lives ultimately intersect. </p><p><em>Sea of Tranquility</em> is a breathtaking and wondrous examination of the ties that bind us together, by a master storyteller. </p>",

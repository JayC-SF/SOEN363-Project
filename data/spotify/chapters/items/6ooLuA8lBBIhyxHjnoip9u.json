    "description": "Author(s): Alicia Elliott\nNarrator(s): Alicia Elliott\n\n<P><B>A bold and profound work by Haudenosaunee writer Alicia Elliott, <I>A Mind Spread Out on the Ground</i> is a personal and critical meditation on trauma, legacy, oppression, and racism in North America.</b></p><P>In an urgent and visceral work that asks essential questions about the treatment of Native people in North America while drawing on intimate details of her own life and experience with intergenerational trauma, Alicia Elliott offers indispensable insight and understanding to the ongoing legacy of colonialism. What are the links between depression, colonialism and loss of language &mdash; both figurative and literal? How does white privilege operate in different contexts? How do we navigate the painful contours of mental illness in loved ones without turning them into their sickness? How does colonialism operate on the level of literary criticism?</P><P><I>A Mind Spread Out on the Ground</i> is Alicia Elliott's attempt to answer these questions and more. In the process, she engages with such wide-ranging topics as race, parenthood, love, mental illness, poverty, sexual assault, gentrification, writing, and representation. Elliott makes connections both large and small between the past and present, the personal and political &mdash; from overcoming a years-long history with head lice to the way Native writers are treated within the Canadian literary industry; her unplanned teenage pregnancy to the history of dark matter and how it relates to racism in the court system; her childhood diet of Kraft dinner to how systematic oppression is linked to depression in Native communities. With deep consideration and searing prose, Elliott extends far beyond her own experiences to provide a candid look at our past, an illuminating portrait of our present, and a powerful tool for a better future.</P>",

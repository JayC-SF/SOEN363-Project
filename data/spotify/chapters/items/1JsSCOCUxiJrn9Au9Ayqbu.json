    "description": "Author(s): Ann Rule\nNarrator(s): Lorelei King\n\nTHE DEFINITIVE WORK OF AMERICAN TRUE CRIME FROM \"AMERICA'S BEST TRUE-CRIME WRITER\" <i>(Kirkus Reviews)</i> <br><br> Utterly unique in its astonishing intimacy, as jarringly frightening as when it first appeared, Ann Rule's <i>The Stranger Beside Me</i> defies our expectation that we would surely know if a monster lived among us, worked alongside of us, appeared as one of us. With a slow chill that intensifies with each heart-pounding page, Rule describes her dawning awareness that Ted Bundy, her sensitive coworker on a crisis hotline, was one of the most prolific serial killers in America. He would confess to killing at least thirty-six young women from coast to coast, and was eventually executed for three of those cases. Drawing from their correspondence that endured until shortly before Bundy's death, and striking a seamless balance between her deeply personal perspective and her role as a crime reporter on the hunt for a savage serial killer -- the brilliant and charismatic Bundy, the man she thought she knew -- Rule changed the course of true-crime literature with this unforgettable chronicle.",

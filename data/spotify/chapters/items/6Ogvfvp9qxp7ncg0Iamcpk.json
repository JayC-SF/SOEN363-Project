    "description": "Author(s): Margaret Atwood\nNarrator(s): Margaret Atwood\n\n<b>NATIONAL BESTSELLER</b><br><b></b><br><b>The collection of a lifetime from the bestselling novelist and poet.</b><br><br>By turns moving, playful and wise, the poems gathered in <i>Dearly</i> are about absences and endings, ageing and retrospection, but also about gifts and renewals. They explore bodies and minds in transition, as well as the everyday objects and rituals that embed us in the present. Werewolves, sirens and dreams make their appearance, as do various forms of animal life and fragments of our damaged environment.<br><br>Before she became one of the world's most important and loved novelists, Atwood was a poet. <i>Dearly</i> is her first collection in over a decade. It brings together many of her most recognizable and celebrated themes, but distilled - from minutely perfect descriptions of the natural world to startlingly witty encounters with aliens, from pressing political issues to myth and legend. It is a pure Atwood delight, and long-term readers and new fans alike will treasure its insight, empathy and humour.",

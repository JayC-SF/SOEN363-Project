    "description": "Author(s): Mark Manson\nNarrator(s): Mark Manson\n\n<p><strong>From <em>New York Times</em> bestseller author Mark Manson, comes an irreverent, interactive journal based on the internationally bestselling phenomenon <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck</em> and the <em>New York Times </em>bestseller <em>Everything is F*cked,</em> providing questions and sharp insights in his inimitable voice.</strong></p><p>In classic Mark Manson style, this journal isn’t a “once a day” or “once a week” thing. You can use it any time. Or not. Leave it and come back. Or not.</p><p><em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck Journal</em> is divided into five sections that mirror the themes of <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck </em>and include guided prompts that help you consider the deepest questions around emotions, values and purpose. Manson’s wisdom is complimented with exercises to make you laugh, think, and grow, and his in-your-face attitude is only matched by his sincerity in wanting you to really wrestle with yourself and the things that matter.  </p><p>When it comes to the big topics—things like happiness, values, and responsibility—life is punctuated by seemingly endless questions. Manson addresses these issues with his unique irreverence, offering insights and observations to help you find your own answers. <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck Journal </em>provides ample space for contemplating life’s ups and downs and guides you to see how key moments in your life—both the tragic and the comic—are opportunities for growth (and sometimes just a good laugh).</p><p>Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook.</p>",

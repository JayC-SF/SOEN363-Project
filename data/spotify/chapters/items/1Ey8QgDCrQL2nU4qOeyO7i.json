    "description": "Author(s): Zoe Hana Mikuta\nNarrator(s): Catherine Ho, Cindy Kay\n\nWe went past praying to deities and started to build them instead.<br />The shadow of Godolia’s tyrannical rule is spreading, aided by their giant mechanized weapons known as Windups. War and oppression are everyday constants for the people of the Badlands, who live under the thumb of their cruel Godolia overlords.<br />Eris Shindanai is a Gearbreaker, a brash young rebel who specializes in taking down Windups from the inside. When one of her missions goes awry and she finds herself in a Godolia prison, Eris meets Sona Steelcrest, a cybernetically enhanced Windup Pilot. At first Eris sees Sona as her mortal enemy, but she soon discovers Sona has a secret: She has intentionally infiltrated the Windup Pilot Program in order to destroy Godolia from within.<br />As the clock ticks closer toward their deadliest mission yet, a direct attack to end Godolia’s reign once and for all, Eris and Sona grow closer as well—as comrades, friends, and perhaps something more …<br />A Junior Library Guild Selection",

We strive so mightily to be good: good partners, daughters, mothers, employees, and friends. We hope all this striving will make us feel alive. Instead, it leaves us feeling weary, stuck, overwhelmed, and underwhelmed. We look at our lives and wonder: <i>Wasn't it all supposed to be more beautiful than this?</i> We quickly silence that question, telling ourselves to be grateful, hiding our discontent&mdash;even from ourselves.</p><p>For many years, Glennon Doyle denied her own discontent. Then, while speaking at a conference, she looked at a woman across the room and fell instantly in love. Three words flooded her mind: <i>There She Is</i>. At first, Glennon assumed these words came to her from on high. But she soon realized they had come to her from within. This was her own voice&mdash;the one she had buried beneath decades of numbing addictions, cultural conditioning, and institutional allegiances. This was the voice of the girl she had been before the world told her who to be. Glennon decided to quit abandoning herself and to instead abandon the world's expectations of her. She quit being good so she could be free. She quit pleasing and started living.</p><p>Soulful and uproarious, forceful and tender, <i>Untamed</i> is both an intimate memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It is the story of how one woman learned that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows them how to fully live. It is the story of navigating divorce, forming a new blended family, and discovering that the brokenness or wholeness of a family depends not on its structure but on each member's ability to bring her full self to the table. And it is the story of how each of us can begin to trust ourselves enough to set boundaries, make peace with our bodies, honor our anger and heartbreak, and unleash our truest, wildest instincts so that we become women who can finally look at ourselves and say:<i> There She Is</i>.</p><p><i>Untamed</i> shows us how to be brave. As Glennon insists: The braver we are, the luckier we get.</p>",

Armentrout's intoxicating new fantasy is her best yet!\" — <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Gena Showalter<br /><br />Meet Trinity Marrow, a girl with an explosive secret whose hiding place has just been discovered…</strong><br /><br />Eighteen-year-old Trinity Marrow may be going blind, but she can see and communicate with ghosts and spirits. Her gift is the reason she’s been in hiding for years in a compound guarded by Wardens—shape-shifters who protect humankind from demons. If the demons discover the truth about Trinity, they’ll devour her to enhance their powers.<br /><br />When Wardens from another clan arrive with reports that something is killing both demons and Wardens, Trinity’s world implodes. Not the least because one of the outsiders is the most annoying and fascinating person she’s ever met. Zayne has secrets of his own—but working together becomes imperative once demons breach the compound and Trinity’s secret comes to light. To save her family and maybe the world, she’ll have to trust Zayne. But all bets are off as a supernatural war is unleashed…<br /><br /><strong>The story continues in the rest of The <em>Harbinger</em> Series, now available with enhanced decorating:</strong><ul><li><strong>Book 1: <em>Storm and Fury</em></strong></li><li><strong>Book 2: <em>Rage and Ruin</em></strong></li><li><strong>Book 3: <em>Grace and Glory</em></strong></li></ul>",

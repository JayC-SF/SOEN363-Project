It is the story of the Whitney Plantation, one of the only former plantations devoted to preserving the experience of the enslaved people whose lives and work sustained it. It is the story of Angola, a former plantation-turned-maximum-security prison in Louisiana that is filled with Black men who work across the 18,000-acre land for virtually no pay. And it is the story of Blandford Cemetery, the final resting place of tens of thousands of Confederate soldiers.<BR /><BR /> A deeply researched and transporting exploration of the legacy of slavery and its imprint on centuries of American history, How the Word Is Passed illustrates how some of our country's most essential stories are hidden in plain view—whether in places we might drive by on our way to work, holidays such as Juneteenth, or entire neighborhoods like downtown Manhattan, where the brutal history of the trade in enslaved men, women, and children has been deeply imprinted.<BR /><BR /> Informed by scholarship and brought to life by the story of people living today, Smith's debut work of nonfiction is a landmark of reflection and insight that offers a new understanding of the hopeful role that memory and history can play in making sense of our country and how it has come to be. </P><P>   </P><P> Instant #1 <I>New York Times</I> Bestseller  </P><P> Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction </P><P> Winner of the Stowe Prize  </P><P> Winner of 2022 Hillman Prize for Book Journalism  </P><P> PEN America 2022 John Kenneth Galbraith Award for Nonfiction Finalist  </P><P> A<I> New York Times</I> 10 Best Books of 2021  </P><P> A <I>Time</I> 10 Best Nonfiction Books of 2021  </P><P> Named a Best Book of 2021 by <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, The Economist, Smithsonian, Esquire, Entropy, The Christian Science Monitor</I>, WBEZ's Nerdette Podcast, <I>TeenVogue, GoodReads, SheReads, BookPage, Publishers Weekly, Kirkus, Fathom Magazine</I>, the New York Public Library, and the Chicago Public Library  </P><P> One of GQ’s 50 Best Books of Literary Journalism of the 21st Century  </P><P> Longlisted for the National Book Award <I>Los Angeles Times</I>, Best Nonfiction Gift  </P><P> One of President Obama's Favorite Books of 2021 </P>",

    "description": "Author(s): Elizabeth Kolbert\nNarrator(s): Rebecca Lowman\n\n<b><i>AudioFile Magazine</i>’s Best Audiobooks of 2021</b><br><br><b>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Sixth Extinction</i> and <i>Field Notes from a Catastrophe</i> returns to humanity’s transformative impact on the environment in <i>Under a White Sky</i>.</b><br><br>That man should have dominion “over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth” is a prophecy that has hardened into fact. So pervasive are human impacts on the planet that it’s said we live in a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene. The question we now face is: Can we change nature, this time in order to save it? <br> <br>Elizabeth Kolbert, the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of <i>The Sixth Extinction,</i> takes a hard look at the new world we are creating. Along the way, she meets scientists who are trying to preserve the world’s rarest fish, which lives in a single, tiny pool in the middle of the Mojave; engineers who are turning carbon emissions to stone in Iceland; Australian researchers who are trying to develop a “super coral” that can survive on a hotter globe; and physicists who are contemplating shooting tiny diamonds into the stratosphere to cool the earth. <br> <br>One way to look at human civilization, says Kolbert, is as a ten-thousand-year exercise in defying nature. In <i>The Sixth Extinction,</i> she explored the ways in which our capacity for destruction has reshaped the natural world. Now she examines how the very sorts of interventions that have imperiled our planet are increasingly seen as the only hope for its salvation. By turns inspiring, terrifying, and darkly comic, <i>Under a White Sky</i> is an utterly original examination of the challenges we face.",

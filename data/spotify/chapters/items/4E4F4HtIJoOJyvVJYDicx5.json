Sly examines how BDSM helped them understand and articulate their gender, how kink helped them turn shameful experiences into liberating ones, and how they became disillusioned with the BDSM scene - without rejecting the lessons fetish taught them.</p>\n\t\t<p>Edem Awumey gives us a darkly moving and terrifying novel about fear and play, repression and protest, and the indomitable nature of creativity.</p> \n\t\t<p>Sexy, gutting, graphic, and existential, <i>Transland</i> is about finding oneself through intense sensations, reaching a point where being hit has diminishing returns, and coming out wiser on the other side.</p>",

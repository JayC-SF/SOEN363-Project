    "description": "Author(s): J.R.R. Tolkien\nNarrator(s): Andy Serkis\n\nTHE GREAT MODERN CLASSIC AND PRELUDE TO THE LORD OF THE RINGS<br />Deep down here by the dark water lived old Gollum, a small slimy creature. I don’t know where he came from, nor who<br />or what he was. He was Gollum—as dark as darkness, except for two big round pale eyes in his thin face. He had a little<br />boat, and he rowed about quite quietly on the lake; for lake it was, wide and deep and deadly cold.<br />Whisked away from his comfortable, unambitious life in his hobbit-hole in Bag End by Gandalf the wizard and a<br />band of dwarves, Bilbo Baggins finds himself caught up in a plot to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent,<br />a large and very dangerous dragon.<br />This brand-new unabridged recording is narrated by the acclaimed actor, director and author, Andy Serkis.",

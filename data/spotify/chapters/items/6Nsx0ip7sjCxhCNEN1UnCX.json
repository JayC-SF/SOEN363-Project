    "description": "Author(s): Erik Larson\nNarrator(s): Scott Brick\n\n<p><b>In <i>The Devil in the White City, </i>the smoke, romance, and mystery of the Gilded Age come alive as never before.</b></p><p>Two men, each handsome and unusually adept at his chosen work, embodied an element of the great dynamic that characterized America's rush toward the twentieth century. The architect was Daniel Hudson Burnham, the fair's brilliant director of works and the builder of many of the country's most important structures, including the Flatiron Building in New York and Union Station in Washington, D.C. The murderer was Henry H.

What makes the story all the more chilling is that Holmes really lived, walking the grounds of that dream city by the lake.</p><p><i>The Devil in the White City</i> draws the listener into a time of magic and majesty, made all the more appealing by a supporting cast of real-life characters, including Buffalo Bill, Theodore Dreiser, Susan B. Anthony, Thomas Edison, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, and others. Erik Larson's gifts as a storyteller are magnificently displayed in this rich narrative of the master builder, the killer, and the great fair that obsessed them both.</p>",

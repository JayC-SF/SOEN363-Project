She also had to learn how to unapologetically put herself first. In <em>Love Me As I Am,</em> she brings together the voices of both the good girl and the rebel to deliver an unflinching examination of her successes and ongoing challenges as a mother, wife, daughter, sibling, and friend. </p><p>Beauvais fearlessly talks about how she boldly embraced her sexuality in her 40s, and her determination to break free of the stereotypes that define and limit African American women in popular culture. Most importantly, she reveals how finally putting herself first led to better relationships with her three sons and even her ex-husband. Beauvais dishes too—offering juicy behind-the-scenes stories from movie sets, red carpet events, and <em>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. </em></p><p><em>Love Me As I Am</em> is an unflinching look at one woman’s extraordinary journey to create a new and more exciting life—and to become the woman she was meant to be.</p>",

Since its inception in 1997, Against Me! has been one of punk's most influential modern bands, but also one of its most divisive. With every notch the four-piece climbed in their career, they gained new fans while infuriating their old ones.

Through a troubled childhood, delinquency, and struggles with drugs, Gabel was on a punishing search for identity.  Not until May of 2012 did a <i>Rolling Stone</i> profile finally reveal it: Gabel is a transsexual, and would from then on be living as a woman under the name Laura Jane Grace.</br></br>  <i>Tranny</i> is the intimate story of Against Me!'s enigmatic founder, weaving the narrative of the band's history, as well as Grace's, with dozens of never-before-seen entries from the piles of journals Grace kept.

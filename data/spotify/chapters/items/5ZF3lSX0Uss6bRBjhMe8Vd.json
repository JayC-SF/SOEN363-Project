The greatest adventure ever told.<br />In a quiet village in the Shire, young Frodo is about to receive a gift that will change his life forever.<br />Thought lost centuries ago, it is the One Ring, an object of terrifying power once used by the Dark Lord to enslave Middle-earth. Now darkness is rising, and Frodo must travel deep into the Dark Lord’s realm, to the one place the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.<br />The journey will test Frodo’s courage, his friendships and his heart. Because the Ring corrupts all who bear it—can Frodo destroy it, or will it destroy him?<br />'The English-speaking world is divided into those who have read The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit and those who are going to read them.'—Sunday Times<br />This brand-new unabridged recording is narrated by the acclaimed actor, director and author, Andy Serkis.",

After World War II, Don's work with the Air Force brought them to Colorado, where their twelve children perfectly spanned the baby boom: the oldest born in 1945, the youngest in 1965. In those years, there was an established script for a family like the Galvins&ndash;aspiration, hard work, upward mobility, domestic harmony&ndash;and they worked hard to play their parts.

By the mid-1970s, six of the ten Galvin boys, one after another, were diagnosed as schizophrenic.

Their story offers a shadow history of the science of schizophrenia, from the era of institutionalization, lobotomy, and the schizophrenogenic mother to the search for genetic markers for the disease, always amid profound disagreements about the nature of the illness itself.

    "description": "Author(s): Dolly Parton, Robert K. Oermann\nNarrator(s): Dolly Parton\n\nA Recorded Books Audio Original production of songs and stories performed by Dolly herself, Dolly Parton, Songteller: My Life in Lyrics goes beyond the glitz, glamour, and rhinestones to the warmth, heart, and soul of a treasured pop-culture icon.<br />In this exclusive audio performance, the ten-time Grammy Award–winning artist weaves her words with music and memories to give listeners the stories behind the stories of her most cherished songs. And with some 3,000 songs to her credit, Dolly uses her gift for lyrics to connect to people of all genders, generations, and geographies.<br />Showcasing nearly 100 of her most popular songs, including “Jolene,” “I Will Always Love You,” “9 to 5,” and “Coat of Many Colors,” to name a few, this one-of-a-kind audio experience delivers answers to fans’ most burning questions: How close did Dolly come to singing “I Will Always Love You” as a duet with Elvis? How did she become an actress? And exactly who was Jolene?<br /> Dolly Parton, Songteller: My Life in Lyrics is a must-have memoir for fans of country music, music history, and (of course!) Dolly herself.",

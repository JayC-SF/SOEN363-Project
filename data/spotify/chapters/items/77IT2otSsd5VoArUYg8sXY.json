Most of us know Tamera Mowry-Housley as a beloved TV star—one‑half of the memorable duo on the hit show <I>Sister, Sister</I> and co-host of the FOX talk show <I>The Real</I>. Tamera’s spunky <I>Sister, Sister</I> character stole the hearts of millions, but the transition in the public eye from teen-girl star to grown woman with a family and thriving career wasn’t easy. Being raised in Hawaii as an army brat instilled in her the discipline needed to succeed and conquer her dreams, but she felt secluded and sheltered, and wondered if living on her own terms would ever be her reality. Then, she decided it would. Vowing to live true to herself, Tamera stopped letting other people define her, tapped into her faith, and tossed away negativity to hone her own happiness and create a unique path forward for herself. In this pink book of quirky advice and storytelling, she encourages everyone to do the same. A celebration of love, cookies, and the juicy parts of life, she’ll leave you feeling liberated and motivated to embrace the highs and lows of growing.<BR /><BR /> In <I>You Should Sit Down for This</I>, Tamera shares heartfelt stories about exiling herself from the world of beauty pageants, the pressures of being a teenage star, her struggle with rejection, the craziness of dating later in life, the challenges of balancing family and career, and why it’s okay for women to hide out in their closets when they just need a few minutes of peace. Tamera doesn’t shy away from the tough experiences, hilarious missteps, and big lessons it took to build a thriving career and the full life she’s living today.  Our favorite girl next door offers “Tameraisms,”—bite-sized pieces of wisdom to empower other women to step up to life’s unexpected turns and surprises and make it all work. <I>You Should Sit Down for This </I>is a much-needed reminder of the magic that can happen when we open our minds and hearts to become the very best versions of ourselves.<BR />",

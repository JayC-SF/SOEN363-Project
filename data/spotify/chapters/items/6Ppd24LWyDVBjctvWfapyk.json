    "description": "Author(s): Farzana Doctor\nNarrator(s): Farzana Doctor, Ellora Patnaik, Raoul Bhaneja\n\nWhen Sharifa and her husband travel to India, she expects her time will be spent researching her great-great grandfather, a wealthy businessman and philanthropist. However, what she doesn’t expect is to be swept up in the story of his four wives, oddly excluded from her family history. <br>  <br> As Sharifa’s imagination is overtaken with these four women, she finds herself in the middle of another female-centered conflict–a conservative, religious ritual that has been going on for centuries. Khatna, or the act of female genital cutting, may be an age-old tradition, but women in India are now taking opposite sides, including Sharifa’s two favourite cousins. <br>  <br> As she tries to find a middle ground, Sharifa’s research excavates an unexpected truth, one that will force her to take a position in this rich novel about resistance and finding your way between cultural traditions and modern values.",

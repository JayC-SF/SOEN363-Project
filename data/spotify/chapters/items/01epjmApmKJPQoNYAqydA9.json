    "description": "Author(s): David McCullough\nNarrator(s): Edward Herrmann\n\nIn this powerful, epic biography, David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life-journey of John Adams, the brilliant, fiercely independent, often irascible, always honest Yankee patriot who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who thought, wrote, and spoke out for the \"Great Cause\" come what might; who traveled far and wide in all seasons and often at extreme risk; who rose to become the second President of the United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; who was rightly celebrated for his integrity, and regarded by some as \"out of his senses\"; and whose marriage to the wise and valiant Abigail Adams is one of the moving love stories in American history. <br> Much about John Adams's life will come as a surprise to many. His rocky relationship with friend and eventual archrival Thomas Jefferson, his courageous voyage on the frigate <I>Boston</I> tin the winter of 1778 and his later trek over the Pyrenees are exploits few would have dared and that few listeners will ever forget. <br> Like his masterful, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography <I>Truman,</I> David McCullough's <I>John Adams</I> has the sweep and vitality of a great novel. This is history on a grand scale -- an audiobook about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, It is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.",

    "description": "Author(s): Maxine Morrey\nNarrator(s): Gloria Sanders\n\n<h2>Lizzie Rose knows what she likes and likes what she knows.</h2><p>Her role at the London Museum is more than a job, it’s her safe place and her passion. So when Lizzie is passed over for a chance in a lifetime opportunity in favour of her ex-boyfriend and fellow Egypt nerd Friedrich Klein, her heartbreak over their relationship pales into insignificance compared to her sadness at losing the project.</p><p>Best friend Colette thinks an evening of cocktails is just the medicine for a broken heart, and meeting dashing, charming, but very much ‘not her type’ Finn Bryson at the bar puts a smile on Lizzie’s face too. But Lizzie isn’t used to spending time outside of her comfortable world of academia and doesn’t believe in mixing business with pleasure. So when Finn’s job brings him to the museum, she’s determined to put an end to any notion of romance between them.</p><p>But what if Lizzie’s comfort zone isn’t that comfortable any more? Is it time for Lizzie to take the chance on love that fate keeps bringing her way - even if it means changing the habits of a lifetime?</p><p><strong>‘Read yourself happy’</strong> with Maxine Morrey’s latest feel-good, unforgettable and utterly uplifting love story, guaranteed to make you smile. Perfect for fans of Mhairi McFarlane and Sophie Kinsella.</p><p><strong>Praise for Maxine Morrey:</strong></p><p>'I absolutely love Maxine’s books - it’s so much fun to be in her world.' <em>Portia Macintosh</em></p><p>'An uplifting read that stops you in your tracks and makes you wonder \"....but what if?\" Absorbing, funny and oh-so-romantic, I loved every page!' <em>Rachel Burton</em></p><p>'A super sweet read, guaranteed to warm any winter evening' <em>Samantha Tonge</em></p><p>'A lovely story that kept me turning the pages' <em>Jules Wake</em></p><p>‘A stunning, perfect novel – it literally took my breath away.’ <em>The Writing Garnet</em>, 5 stars</p><p>‘A warm hug of a book.’ <em>Rachel’s Random Reads</em>, 5 stars</p><p><strong>What readers say about Maxine Morrey:</strong></p><p>‘I loved it from start to finish, favourite book by far this summer ☀️ looking forward to reading more from this author.’</p><p>‘Yet another superb summery, sunshine read from Maxine.

The characters are so incredibly well written, their stories are so real and their emotional journeys of healing past hurt and trauma are so beautifully touching. For me, I think this story is one of the best I have read in a really long time, so much so that I re-read the last few chapters over again.’</p><p>‘I'm a huge fan of Maxine Morrey's books, so shockingly this won’t be an unbiased review, it’s going to be completely and unashamedly biased and gushing about her wonderful, poignant, thought provoking stories which make me emotional but always happy by the end when I read them.’</p><p>‘Another amazing story from Maxine Morrey. So beautifully written, lovely characters, the whole Book feels like a warm hug. I couldn’t put it down!’</p><p>‘Loved this book an easy read and found it hard to put down.

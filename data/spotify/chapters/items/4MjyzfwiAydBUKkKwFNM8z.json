    "description": "Author(s): Miriam Toews\nNarrator(s): Matthew Edison\n\n<p><b>A transformative and necessary work&mdash;as completely unexpected as it is inspired&mdash;by the award-winning author of the best-selling novels <i>All My Puny Sorrows</i> and <i>A Complicated Kindness</i>.</b></p><p>The sun rises on a quiet June morning in 2009. August Epp sits alone in the hayloft of a barn, anxiously bent over his notebook. He writes quickly, aware that his solitude will soon be broken. Eight women&mdash;ordinary grandmothers, mothers, and teenagers; yet to August, each one extraordinary&mdash;will climb the ladder into the loft, and the day's true task will begin. This task will be both simple and subversive: August, like the women, is a traditional Mennonite, and he has been asked to record a secret conversation.</p><p>Thus begins Miriam Toews' spellbinding novel. Gradually, as we hear the women's vivid voices console, tease, admonish, regale, and debate each other, we piece together the reason for the gathering: they have 48 hours to make a life-altering choice on behalf of all the women and children in the colony. And like a vast night sky coming into view behind the bright sparks of their voices, we learn of the devastating events that have led to this moment.</p><p>Acerbic, funny, tender, sorrowful, and wise, Women Talking is composed of equal parts humane love and deep anger. It is award-winning writer Miriam Toews' most astonishing novel to date, containing within its two short days and hayloft setting an expansive, timeless universe of thinking and feeling about women&mdash;and men&mdash;in our contemporary world.</p>",

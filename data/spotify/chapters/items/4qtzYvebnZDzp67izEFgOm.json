    "description": "Author(s): Jody Wilson-Raybould\nNarrator(s): Jody Wilson-Raybould\n\n<b>From the #1 bestselling author of <i>'Indian' in the Cabinet</i>, a groundbreaking and accessible roadmap to advancing true reconciliation across Canada.</b><br><br>There is one question Canadians have asked Jody Wilson-Raybould more than any other: <i>What can I do to help advance reconciliation?</i> This has been true from her time as a leader of British Columbia’s First Nations, as a Member of Parliament, as Minister of Justice and Attorney General, within the business communities she interacts, and when having conversations with people around their kitchen tables. Whether speaking as individuals, communities, organizations, or governments, people want to take concrete and tangible action that will make real change. They just need to know how to get started, or to take the next step. For Wilson-Raybould, what individuals and organizations need to do to advance true reconciliation is self-evident, accessible, and achievable. <br>  <br> <i>True Reconciliation</i> is broken down into three core practices—<i>Learn</i>, <i>Understand</i>, and <i>Act—</i>that can be applied by individuals, communities, organizations, and governments. They are based on the historical and contemporary experience of Indigenous peoples in their relentless efforts to effect transformative change and decolonization; and deep understanding and expertise about what has been effective in the past, what we are doing right, and wrong, today, and what our collective future requires. <i>True Reconciliation</i>, ultimately, is about building transformed patterns of just and harmonious relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples at all levels of society. <br> <br> Throughout the book, the author shares her voice and experience with others who tell their stories. To help with the practices of learning, understanding, and acting, there is a planning guide at the end of the book—to help the reader translate words into action for themselves as individuals, for their communities, organizations, and governments at all levels. The ultimate and achievable goal of <i>True Reconciliation</i> is to break down the silos we've created that prevent meaningful change, to be empowered to increasingly act as ‘inbetweeners,’ and to take full advantage of this moment in our history to positively transform the country into a place we can all be proud of.",

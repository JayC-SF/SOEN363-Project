    "description": "Author(s): Tomson Highway\nNarrator(s): Jimmy Blais\n\n<b>NATIONAL BESTSELLER</b><br> <br><b>Capricious, big-hearted, joyful: an epic memoir from one of Canada’s most acclaimed Indigenous writers and performers</b><br><br>Tomson Highway was born in a snowbank on an island in the sub-Arctic, the eleventh of twelve children in a nomadic, caribou-hunting Cree family. Growing up in a land of ten thousand lakes and islands, Tomson relished being pulled by dogsled beneath a night sky alive with stars, sucking the juices from roasted muskrat tails, and singing country music songs with his impossibly beautiful older sister and her teenaged friends. Surrounded by the love of his family and the vast, mesmerizing landscape they called home, his was in many ways an idyllic far-north childhood. But five of Tomson's siblings died in childhood, and Balazee and Joe Highway, who loved their surviving children profoundly, wanted their two youngest sons, Tomson and Rene, to enjoy opportunities as big as the world. And so when Tomson was six, he was flown south by float plane to attend a residential school. A year later Rene joined him to begin the rest of their education. In 1990 Rene Highway, a world-renowned dancer, died of an AIDS-related illness. <i>Permanent Astonishment: Growing Up in the Land of Snow and Sky</i> is Tomson's extravagant embrace of his younger brother's final words: \"Don't mourn me, be joyful.\" His memoir offers insights, both hilarious and profound, into the Cree experience of culture, conquest, and survival.<br>",

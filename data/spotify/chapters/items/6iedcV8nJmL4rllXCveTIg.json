Shuri is a skilled martial artist, a genius, and a master of science and technology. But, she's also a teenager. And a princess. This middle-grade series follows Shuri as she sets out on a quest to save her homeland of Wakanda.</p><p>For centuries, the Chieftain of Wakana (the Black Panther) has gained his powers through the juices of the Heart Shaped Herb. Indeed, even Shuri herself has gained powers from this mythical herb, which grows only in Wakanda. Much like Vibranium, the Heart Shaped Herb is essential to the survival and prosperity of Wakanda. But something is wrong. The plants are no longer growing. No matter what the people of Wakanda do, they can't create new herbs. And their supply is running short. It's up to Shuri to travel from Wakanda in order to discover what is killing the Herb, and how she can save it, in this new, original series.</p>",

    "description": "Author(s): Laura Piper Lee\nNarrator(s): Kelli Tager\n\nHannah Tate can hardly believe her sleep-deprived eyes when she finds an engagement ring hidden in the closet. Killian, her super responsible, incredibly attractive boyfriend—and the father of her new baby, Bowie—is finally going to propose. But a romantic night out goes horribly wrong when Killian reveals he’s dumping Hannah, not proposing. Furious and heartbroken, Hannah takes Bowie and moves in with her mama and stepdaddy in the mountains of Blue Ridge, Georgia. Hannah realizes that her parents’ cabin has vacation-property gold written all over it—and could save her mama from going broke. Again. The only problem? The cabin’s décor is mildly terrifying, and it’s in desperate need of renovation. Hannah hires the hot carpenter living in the treehouse next door to fix up the place. Not only does River respect Hannah’s business acumen, he looks at her like she’s a woman, not a hot mess. And Hannah can’t deny that River awakens something new inside her. Can Hannah embrace a future that looks different from the picture-perfect family she once dreamed of—and maybe start living life on her own terms?",

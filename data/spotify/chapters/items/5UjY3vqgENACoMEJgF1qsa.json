He describes his initially unpromising first date with his now-fiancé Josh, involving an 18-pack of Coors Light and an afternoon of watching NASCAR.

The book “is insightful, funny, and instructive for anyone who’s ever grappled with how they fit into the American dream” (Ronan Farrow, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author), and demonstrates that no matter who you are and where you come from, you have many more choices than those presented to you.

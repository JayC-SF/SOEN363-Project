    "description": "Author(s): Ernest Hemingway\nNarrator(s): Donald Sutherland\n\nHemingway's Pulitzer Prize-winning classic <br> <br> <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> is one of Hemingway's most enduring works. Told in language of great simplicity and power, it is the story of an old Cuban fisherman, down on his luck, and his supreme ordeal -- a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. Here Hemingway recasts, in strikingly contemporary style, the classic theme of courage in the face of defeat, of personal triumph won from loss. Written in 1952, this hugely successful novella confirmed his power and presence in the literary world and played a large part in his winning the 1954 Nobel Prize for literature. <br> <br> <b>Ernest Hemingway</b> did more to change the style of English prose than any other writer in the twentieth century, and for his efforts he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1954. Hemingway wrote in short, declarative sentences and was known for his tough, terse prose. Publication of <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> and <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> immediately established Ernest Hemingway as one of the greatest literary lights of the twentieth century. As part of the expatriate community in 1920s Paris, the former journalist and World War I ambulance driver began a career that lead to international fame. Hemingway was an aficionado of bullfighting and big-game hunting, and his main protagonists were always men and women of courage and conviction, who suffered unseen scars, both physical and emotional. He covered the Spanish Civil War, portraying it in fiction in his brilliant novel <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i>, and he subsequently covered World War II. His classic novella <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. He died in 1961.",

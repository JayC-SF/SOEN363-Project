    "description": "Author(s): Samara Bay\nNarrator(s): Samara Bay\n\n<b>Use your voice to lead us to a better future with this game-changing guide to redefining what power and authority sound like—from a speech expert who’s worked with Hollywood’s biggest stars, political powerhouses, and businesspeople shaking up the status quo.</b><br><br><b>“I <i>love</i> this book—funny, surprising, stirring, and so important! What a beautiful accomplishment and gift to put into the world.”—Rachel McAdams</b><br><br>Getting heard is a tricky business: It’s what you say and how you show up, filtered through your audience’s assumptions and biases—and maybe even your own. For women, people of color, immigrants, and queer folks, there’s often a dissonance between how you speak and how we collectively think powerful people <i>should</i> speak: like the wealthy white men who’ve historically been in charge. But, fortunately, the sound of power is changing.<br><br><i>Permission to Speak</i> is your tool kit for making that change. In this revolutionary take on how to use your voice to get what you want, sought-after speech coach Samara Bay offers a fresh perspective on public speaking and a new definition of what power sounds like: namely, you. Blending anecdotes with eye-opening research in leadership, linguistics, and social science, <i>Permission to Speak</i> shows you how to strike the right balance of strength and warmth to land your message; exactly what to do before a high-stakes scenario so that your voice, your mind, and your spirit are ready; and how to turn habits like vocal fry and upspeak into tools. Most important, you’ll discover your voice story: why you talk the way you do, what’s wonderful about it, and what you’ve outgrown.<br><br>Fiery, fun, and truly profound, <i>Permission to Speak</i> is a personal and cultural reckoning with what speaking in public is and what it <i>can be</i>. This book meets the moment and offers this provocation: When we change what power sounds like, we change who has it.<br><br><b>*Includes a downloadable PDF that offers exercises from the book for you to reference later</b>",

While covering the explosion of the digital sector in the early 1990s, she developed a long track record of digging up and reporting the facts about this new world order. Her consistent scoops drove one CEO to accuse her of “listening in the heating ducts” and prompted Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg to once observe: “It is a constant joke in the Valley when people write memos for them to say, ‘I hope Kara never sees this.’”<br> <br> While still in college, Swisher got her start at <i>The</i> <i>Washington Post</i>, where she became one of the few people in journalism interested in covering the nascent Internet. She went on to work for <i>The</i> <i>Wall</i> <i>Street Journal</i>, joining with Walt Mossberg to start the groundbreaking <i>D: All Things Digital </i>conference, as well as pioneering tech news sites.<br> <br>Swisher has interviewed everyone who matters in tech over three decades, right when they presided over an explosion of world-changing innovation that has both helped and hurt our world. Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Sheryl Sandberg, Bob Iger, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Meg Whitman, Peter Thiel, Sam Altman, and Mark Zuckerberg are just a few whom Swisher made sweat—figuratively and, in Zuckerberg’s case, literally.<br> <br>Despite the damage she chronicles, Swisher remains optimistic about tech’s potential to help solve problems and not just create them.

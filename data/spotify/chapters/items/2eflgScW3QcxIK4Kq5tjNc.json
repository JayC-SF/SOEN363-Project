With <i>How to Write an Autobiographical Novel, </i>his first collection of nonfiction, he is sure to secure his place as one of the finest essayists of his generation as well.</p>\n<p><i>How to Write an Autobiographical Novel</i> is the author's manifesto on the entangling of life, literature, and politics, and how the lessons learned from a life spent reading and writing fiction have changed him. In these essays, he grows from student to teacher, reader to writer, and reckons with his identities as a son, a gay man, a Korean American, an artist, an activist, a lover, and a friend. He examines some of the most formative experiences of his life and the nation's history, including his father's death, the AIDS crisis, 9/11, the jobs that supported his writing - Tarot-reading, bookselling, cater-waiting for William F. Buckley - the writing of his first novel, <i>Edinburgh</i>, and the election of Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>By turns commanding, heartbreaking, and wry, <i>How to Write an Autobiographical Novel</i> asks questions about how we create ourselves in life and in art and how to fight when our dearest truths are under attack.</p>\n<p>A <i>BookRiot </i>Pick of Books to Read If You Love \"Pose\". </p>\n<p>An <i>Entertainment Weekly </i>Best Book of the Year (So Far). </p>\n<p>A <i>Chicago Review of Books</i> Pick of Best of the Year (So Far). </p>\n<p>A <i>Buzzfeed</i> Best Books of the Year (So Far). </p>\n<p>A <i>Wired Magazine</i> Pick of Must-Read Summer Titles. </p>\n<p>An <i>Esquire Magazine</i> Pick of Best Books of 2018 (So Far). </p>\n<p>A <i>Christian Science Monitor </i>selection of 2018's Most Anticipated Books. </p>\n<p>A <i>Bustle</i> Pick of Most Anticipated Books of 2018. </p>\n<p>A <i>Bitch magazine</i> pick of Most Anticipated Nonfiction for 2018. </p>\n<p>A <i>Pop Sugar</i> Pick of Most Anticipated Upcoming Books. </p>\n<p>A <i>Paste Magazine </i>Pick of Most Anticipated Books of 2018. </p>\n<p>A <i>Publishers Weekly</i> Best Book of 2018.</p>",

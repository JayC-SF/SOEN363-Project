She packs up her sword, her shoes, and her dirty magazines, and prepares to launch her daring escape. But Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House and bone witch extraordinaire, has other plans for her childhood nemesis.</P><P>The Emperor has come calling, inviting the heirs to each of his loyal Houses to a deadly trial of wits and skill. If Harrow succeeds she will be elevated to Lyctorhood, becoming an immortal, all-powerful servant of the Resurrection, but no necromancer can ascend without their cavalier. Without Gideon's sword, Harrowhark will fail, and the Ninth House will die. Of course, some things are better left dead.</P>",
